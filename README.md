# HackED 2024 Receipt Scanner
A rough draft of a website for scanning receipts. The draft was made in four hours and I was learning Next.js while I was making the site, so the site is very unfinished. There are three pages:
- The homepage, it displays a list of scanned receipts.
- A page to render the details of a receipt.
- A page to add a new receipt. The user fills out a form describing the receipt's details, and then submits it. 

## Possible Improvements
- A cohesive visual design.
- Adding a backend so that receipts can be stored in a database.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
